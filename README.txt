In order to open our flight booking app you need to run the project on an Android Studio emulator. These are the steps you can take to get full functionality:
	
1. Open the project in Android Studio. 


2. Create an emulator if you haven’t already done so. The emulator needs to be on minimum API 8: Froyo. Any screen/phone size will do. Any higher API will also work. 


3. Open the Android Device Monitor and push the client and flight csv files to the device with flights that you want to upload.
	
Note: The emulator has to have run in order to show up on the Device Monitor. 	

These files need to go onto the devices storage (SD card) which is located at mnt/sdcard. 

Note: The files need to be in the sdcard folder and not inside a folder inside the sdcard, unless you specify that during upload. 

If you would like to use a custom login, push your password.txt file to application context directory: data/data/pw.tayyab.flightbookingapp/ folder. 

Otherwise you can login using: 
	
	Admin:
		username: admin@email.com
		password: test 
	Client:
		username: client@email.com
		password: test


4. Then run the emulator through Android Studio. 

Thats all it takes to run!
